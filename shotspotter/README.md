# Shotspotter

The `shotspotter` data package includes the location and timing of gunshots detected by the shotspotter system. Shotspotter reports are filtered from all [police calls for service](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/safety/PDI-Police-Data-Initiative-Police-Calls-for-Servic/gexm-h6bt) that resulted in a police response and had a known location and date.

A filter is applied to `date-time`, the estimated date/time of the start of the crime, to included crime incidents that occurred on or after January 1, 2011.
